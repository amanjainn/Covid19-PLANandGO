# Plan&Go - An Application to fight against COVID19 (BMSCE Hackathon)


Since we are facing critical situation due to the COVID 19 pandemic. To win against this pandemic and to come out of this situation most crucial thing we have to follow is social-distancing.But, the problem is people are panicking and are rushing to get their basic daily-life commodities like milk, water, grocery, medicines etc. to the nearby shop's and coming in contact with various people at the cash counters. Because of this behaviour, gathering at the same place (mostly at the same time) they are risking their as well as others life by not following SOCIAL DISTANCING.


So we came up with an idea to deal with the present situation and making things happen in a smooth and DISCIPLINED manner for the people. We are developing an automated system by which every individual can get their essential commodities without being in crowd and waiting in queues outside of shops. In our application "PLAN&GO" we are providing features so that every indivual can find shops nearby their location as per their requirement.
